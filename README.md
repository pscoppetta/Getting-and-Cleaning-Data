CodeBook.md - describes original data source used in this assignment project, and the transformations made 
tidydataset.txt - final output of run_analysis.R script execution
Readme.md - short sumamrized description what I made to prepare TidyDataSet.txt file
run_analysis.R - is the script prepared to transform original dataset to tidydataset.txt data, and follows the steps required in the project instructions: 
  1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
  3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
  5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
